## Overview

This is a project for the course Developing Data Products on Coursera as part of the Data Science specialisation.
So, here's a random tourist spots that I pick up from my country, Thailand.

## Coding

```{r import}
library(leaflet)
```

```{r map}
monuments<-data.frame(lat=c(7.7461,13.3602,12.60924),lng=c(98.7784,99.9130,102.11865),name=c("Phi Phi Island","Amphawa District","Cathedral of the Immaculate Conception"))
my_map<-monuments %>% leaflet() %>% addTiles() %>% addMarkers(popup =monuments$name,clusterOptions = markerClusterOptions())
my_map
```
